Function    

Recursion  
- A defined function can call itself. It is a common mathmatical and programming concept.  
- Every recursive function requires to have a parameter and a base condition.

Formula:

def function(parameter1):
  if(condition): # base condition
    return something
  else:
    return something + function(parameter2)


Where can we apply?
- Things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach. 
- Recursion works well for searching through types of structure (data structure) because it
can search multiple branching paths without having many checks/conditions.
